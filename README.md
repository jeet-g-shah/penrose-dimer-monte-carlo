# penrose-dimer-monte-carlo
Monte Carlo code to calculate correlators of a quantum monomer-dimer model on the quasicrystalline Penrose tiling. The code calculates dimer-dimer, vison-vison correlators as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to monomers and visons. The results from this code were used in the preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588

# Getting started

First, clone this repository and extract the data.zip file. 

There are three parts to the code:

1. Part to generate the Penrose tiling and save all the requried information about the graph such as the location of the vertices and the adjacency matrix. This data is stored in /data/tiling_input

2.
