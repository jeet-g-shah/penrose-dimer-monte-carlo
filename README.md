# penrose-dimer-monte-carlo
Monte Carlo code to calculate correlators of a quantum monomer-dimer model on the quasicrystalline Penrose tiling. The code calculates dimer-dimer, vison-vison correlators as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to monomers and visons. The results from this code were used in the preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588

### The code will be uploaded soon...
